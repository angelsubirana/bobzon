<h1>The Share button is missing! How to enable it?</h1>

<p>The problem is: you open the share extensions view in your device but the “Add Product to Bobzon” option is not available. Follow the next steps in order to make it appear.</p>

<p>1.- Open whatever website in Safari. After the website is loaded, open the share extensions view with the activities button (the squared one in the middle).</p>

<p>2.- Scroll to the right in order to make sure our Share button is not hidden there. If not found then tap the “More” button, the most right one.</p>

<p>3.- Once in the Activities list, search for the Add Products to Bobzon” option and check it. We also recommend to move the button to the top in order to make it more easily available when needed.</p>
