# How to enable the Share button?

By default, iOS doesn't activate new share extensions in your device so we will need to enable it. Follow the next steps in order to make appear the "Add Product to Bobzon" share button in the share extensions view.

1.- Open whatever website in Safari. After the website is loaded, open the share extensions view with the activities button (the squared one in the middle).

2.- Scroll to the right in order to make sure our Share button is not hidden there. If not found then tap the "More" button, the most right one.

3.- Once in the Activities list, search for the Add Products to Bobzon" option and check it. We also recommend to move the button to the top in order to make it more easily available when needed.
